@pytest.mark.xfail
def test_xpassed():
    assert 0.0 < random.random() < 1.0


@pytest.mark.skip(reason="don't run this test")
def test_skipped():
    assert "pytest-emoji" != ""


@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "name, expected",
    [
        ("Sara", "Hello Sara!"),
        ("Mat", "Hello Mat!"),
        ("Annie", "Hello Annie!"),
    ],

def test_passed(name, expected):
